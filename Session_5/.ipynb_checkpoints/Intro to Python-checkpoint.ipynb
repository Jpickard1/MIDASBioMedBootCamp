    "3. Reference (access the value)\n",

For a set of `if` statements, once a section has been executed, the code skips checking the remaining `if`, `elif`, or `else` conditions. The condition being checked, also know as a predicate, must take the form of an expression that evaluates to `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the conditions could be `x < 5`, `x > 5` and `x == 5` (`x` equals 5) must always be either True or False, and the truth value of these statments depends on the value of `x`. These are good predicates.\n",

The second predicate is bad because it is always `True`. Every number is either equal to 5 or not equal to 5, so no matter the value of `x`, the first predicate is `False` and the second predicate is `True`.\n",
